        //Advantage of arrow function
        //1.Consie the code-You can make your code very short then you can write ur one liner code.
        //2.Implicit return-Here Return is optional.
        //3.No 'this' binding==There is no "this binding" i.e there is no function context creation it used parent context creation
        //Arrow function with one paramter
        let square = n=>n*n;
        console.log(`The square of number is`,square(4));

        //If there is no argument then
        let birthDayWish = ()=>console.log('Happy Birthday!!!');
        birthDayWish()

        //More than one argument in arrow function
        let sum = (a,b)=>{
            return a+b
        }
        console.log("The sum of two number is "+sum(19,20));
