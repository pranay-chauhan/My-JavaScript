1.Difference between var, let and const
==>a)var is fucntion scoped where as let and const are block scope.
   b)Block scope means with any curly braces(i.e within any loops)
   c)Function scope means within any function
  
  Note-If Function defined inside the function with var keyword then it will be local means it will be access only that fuction,
  and if the variable defined outside the fuction with var keyword then it will be global scope
